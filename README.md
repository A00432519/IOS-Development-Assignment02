App Developed:- Upon clicking the "Nope Not Really" button, the control goes to "NewWondersViewController" that parse the Json file to fetch the names of the 7 wonders and render it in a table view. The user can click on any table cell to see the details in the next screen i.e. "WonderDetailsViewController". The "WonderDetailsViewController" displays the respective wonder object details i.e. Name, Description and the Image. The image Url is fetched from the Wonders.json and if success result (HTTP -200) encountered, the same image will be displayed in the "WonderDetailsViewController".

Note: We are sharing one Mac so the combined effort has been commited in one go in the GitHub. Please let us know if any changes required for the next task.
